# Zone.JS integration for meteor

With [Zone.JS](https://github.com/angular/zone.js) integration, we can follow Meteor's async execution path (in client) and identify more information which is not possible before.

As a result of that, error tracking can be improved and it can be used to capture stack traces over the async execution path.

### Installation
    
    meteor add itgenio:zones

    // for older Meteor version
    mrt add zones

That's all you've to do :)

### Integration with Kadira

If you've added zones into a Meteor application which is being monitored with Kadira, error tracking on client can be improved dramatically. See following error trace:
